 * Bundles the CLI into `plugin/bin/holiday.mjs` — one file, no dependencies.
 *
 * This is what a Claude Code plugin actually needs. Plugins are copied into a
 * versioned cache with NO install step, so there is no `pnpm install` and no
 * postinstall to compile anything. Whatever is committed is what runs.
 *
 * That constraint is why the SQLite adapter uses `node:sqlite` rather than
 * better-sqlite3: a native addon cannot be bundled, and shipping per-platform
 * prebuilds or a vendored node_modules into a plugin is not a thing. node:sqlite
 * is a builtin, so it stays external here and resolves at runtime.
 *
 * The committed output rots if nobody watches it, so CI re-bundles and diffs
 * against the committed file.
