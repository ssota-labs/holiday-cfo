 *   Assets:Bank:Wise:USD  750.00 USD @@ 1000000
 *
 * `@@` is a TOTAL price, not a rate — which is exactly what a weight is. There is
 * deliberately no `@` (per-unit rate) form: a rate multiplied back out is lossy at
 * integer scale, and accepting one here would smuggle the tolerance problem in
 * through the front door. If you know the rate but not the counter-amount, that is
 * what `holiday fx` will be for.

 * The caller resolves the rate ONCE per transaction and hands the same closure to
 * every leg. That is not an optimisation — it is what makes a same-currency
 * charge balance. A USD purchase on a USD card has two legs of ±$12.50; if each
 * resolved its own rate they could disagree by a won and the transaction would
 * not sum to zero. One rate cancels exactly.
