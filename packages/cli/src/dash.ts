/**
 * `holiday dash` — scaffold a dashboard, and bake the snapshot it renders.
 *
 * The split is the design, not an implementation detail:
 *
 *   dash init   writes a vinext project that reads two JSON files
 *   dash data   fills ONE of them, from the ledger
 *   the agent   fills the OTHER — the layout — and can put no figure in it
 *
 * The dashboard never opens ledger.db. That is what lets one build run both on a
 * laptop and on Codex Sites, which is Cloudflare underneath: no Node runtime, no
 * filesystem, no node:sqlite. A snapshot is the only thing that can cross that
 * line — and since Sites is OpenAI-hosted and this is the user's money, the only
 * thing that should.

 * Where the templates live, relative to whatever is executing.

 *   npm      dist/main.js      → ../templates/   (files: ["dist", "templates"])
 *   plugin   bin/holiday.mjs   → ../templates/   (copied there at bundle time)

 * disagree — a balance from before and a runway from after, each individually
 * correct. Nobody would ever catch that by looking.
 *
 * It is a unitOfWork rather than a read only because `verify()` lives on the
 * write interface; nothing here writes. `holiday verify` does the same.
