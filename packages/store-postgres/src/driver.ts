/**
 * `?` → `$1, $2, …`, and the store's SQLite spelling → Postgres.
 *
 * Rewriting at query time rather than hand-editing the store is the entire point:
 * a hand-edit renumbers every parameter after any insertion, and a mis-numbered
 * `$4` binds the wrong column *silently*. This cannot. More importantly, hand-
 * editing means a second copy of the store, and a second copy drifts.
 *
 * The rewrites are small and total — they are the eight dialect-specific spots
 * that a count found in ~1,500 lines:
 *
 * - **`?` → `$n`.** Postgres numbers its placeholders.
 * - **GLOB → LIKE.** Only ever the materialized-path subtree query,
 *   `code GLOB 'Assets:Bank:*'`. The store spells it GLOB because it needs a
 *   case-SENSITIVE match and SQLite's LIKE is not one; Postgres's LIKE is. The
 *   wildcard itself comes from `dialect.subtreeWildcard`, not from here.
 * - **INSERT OR IGNORE → ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.** Note this APPENDS: dropping
 *   `OR IGNORE` alone would turn a tolerated duplicate into a raised unique
 *   violation, which is the opposite of what the caller asked for.

 * which take `bigint | number`, so a client without an int8 parser hands the
 * ledger strings and `units_minor` starts concatenating instead of adding.
 *
 * This is node:sqlite's setReadBigInts problem arrived at from the opposite
 * direction — SQLite would have handed back a lossy number, Postgres hands back a
 * lossless string — and it gets the same answer: one place that knows, and no way
 * to forget. The parser has to be set at client construction, which this cannot do
 * for a client it was handed, so it checks instead. A ledger that silently does
 * string arithmetic on money is not a failure mode worth being polite about.
