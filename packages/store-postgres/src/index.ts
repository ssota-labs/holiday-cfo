/**
 * @holiday-cfo/store-postgres — the ledger on Postgres (Supabase, or pglite in tests).
 *
 * This package is a driver, a schema, and migrations. It does NOT implement
 * LedgerStore: that lives once in @holiday-cfo/store-sql and both engines run it.
 *
 * The reason is a measurement rather than a preference. The store is ~1,500 lines
 * and exactly eight of them were dialect-specific; mirroring it here would have
 * produced two files that agree today and drift on the first hand-edit that lands
 * in one and not the other — which is the failure the port boundary exists to
 * prevent.
 *
 * The proof it works is `store.test.ts`: the same conformance suite SQLite passes,
 * run against real Postgres via pglite.
