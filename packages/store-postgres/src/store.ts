 * The Postgres engine: a driver, the DDL, and nothing else.
 *
 * There is no `checkpoint` because Postgres has no WAL-into-file step to run and
 * no need for one, and no `init` pragmas because its equivalents are server
 * configuration rather than per-connection state. That this file is short is the
 * result the port boundary was supposed to buy: the ~1,500 lines of store are in
 * @holiday-cfo/store-sql and are the *same* lines SQLite runs.
