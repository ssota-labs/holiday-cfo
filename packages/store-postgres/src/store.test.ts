 * The conformance suite, run against real Postgres.
 *
 * pglite is not a mock and not a Postgres-alike: it is Postgres compiled to WASM,
 * running in this process. Same planner, same triggers, same int8 semantics, no
 * server and no Docker. Which means the same 26 cases SQLite passes run here, and
 * this adapter does not ship on the strength of "it looks like the other one".
 *
 * That matters more than usual for this package. Its whole claim is that ONE
 * store implementation serves both engines — and the only thing that can turn
 * that claim from a design sketch into a fact is a second engine actually passing.
