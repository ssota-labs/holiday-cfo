/**
 * "Will the cash survive the bills that are already coming?" — assembled once.
 *
 * This lived inside the `holiday cashflow` command, which was fine while the CLI
 * was the only caller. It is not: the dashboard needs the same answer, and a
 * dashboard that re-assembles it from the same domain functions would be a second
 * implementation of the hardest read in the system. Two implementations agree on
 * the day they are written and drift on the first fix that lands in one of them.
 * That is the same argument that collapsed two stores into one, and it applies
 * harder here, because a projection that quietly disagrees with the CLI is not a
 * bug anyone notices — both numbers look plausible.
 *
 * So the CLI formats this, the dashboard bakes this, and neither computes it.
 *
 * Pure with respect to time: `asOf` is a parameter. Nothing here calls Date.now().
 */

/**
 * Something real that this projection does NOT include.
 *
 * Not decoration. A projection that silently omits an outflow reads as
 * reassurance when it should read as "I don't know" — so every caller is handed
 * the gaps along with the numbers, and the dashboard is expected to show them
 * next to the runway rather than beneath a fold.
