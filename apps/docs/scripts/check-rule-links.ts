/**
 * Verifies every <Rule> points at a test that actually exists and actually runs.
 *
 * This script is the reason <Rule> is worth having. A policy doc that merely
 * *claims* a rule is enforced is a wish; one whose link is checked in CI cannot
 * quietly become false. Two ways it would rot without this:
 *
 *   1. The test file gets renamed or moved → the link 404s and nobody notices.
 *   2. The `it(...)` gets renamed or deleted → the doc cites a test that no longer
 *      exists, which is worse than citing nothing, because it reads as proof.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter @holiday-cfo/docs check:rules
