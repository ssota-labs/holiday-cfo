description: Record and query a personal double-entry ledger — 가계부, 카드 거래, 부채, 할부, 정기지출, 현금흐름 예측. Use when the user wants to record spending or income, asks what they owe or own, asks whether their cash will survive upcoming card bills (현금흐름), sets up a card/할부/정기지출, or closes their books. Also use when the user shares a screenshot of a bank or card transaction and wants it recorded. Do NOT use for general financial advice or investment questions.

# holiday — a double-entry ledger you drive from chat

`holiday` is a CLI. You run it; it owns the accounting. Every command takes
`--json` for machine-readable output on stdout, and errors always come back as a
single JSON envelope on stderr: `{"error":{"code":"...","message":"..."}}`.

## Running it

Codex has no bundled binary, so invoke the CLI through npm:

```bash
npx @holiday-cfo/cli@latest <command>
```

The first run downloads it. Everything after this document writes `holiday <cmd>`;
read that as `npx @holiday-cfo/cli@latest <cmd>`. Run `holiday --help` or
`holiday <command> --help` for exact flags.

**If a command reports `no .holiday/ found`, the user is starting fresh.** Ask,
then `npx @holiday-cfo/cli@latest init --currency KRW`. Tell them the directory
must be a **private** repository — ledger.db is their money.

## The rules you must not break

**Never invent an amount, a date, or an account.** If a receipt is blurry or the
user is vague, ask. This is the user's money, and you are the least reliable
component in the system — everything downstream assumes you read `₩1,240,000`
and not `₩1,240,00`.

**Every transaction must balance to exactly zero.** There is no tolerance. If
`holiday txn add` refuses with `unbalanced`, it tells you the exact residual; do
not "fix" it by nudging a number. Find the missing leg — a fee, a discount, a
rounding line — or ask.

**Never guess an account.** Run `holiday account list` and use what exists. If the
right account is missing, propose creating it and say what you'd call it.

**Show your work before you write.** For anything non-obvious, state the double
entry you're about to post in plain language and let the user confirm.

## Getting oriented

```bash
holiday account list          # what accounts exist
holiday balance               # what is owned and owed right now
holiday verify                # is the ledger sound and the audit chain intact
holiday cashflow --until 2026-12-31   # will the cash survive what is already coming
```

`cashflow` is usually the real question behind "how am I doing": it walks forward
from today's cash and subtracts every card bill, 할부 row and 정기지출 already
committed, and flags the day the balance goes negative. Read the ⚠ line out loud.

## Recording from a screenshot

What you submit lands as a **draft**, excluded from every balance until a human
accepts it. Pass `--idem-key` on every submit so a retry replays instead of
double-posting. The draft must balance, and the gate is not permission to guess —
a human confirming `₩1,240,00` confirms it wrong. See `references/recipes.md` for
the exact `ingest submit` shape and the review flow.

## Showing it as a dashboard

```bash
holiday dash init          # writes ./dash — a vinext app
cd dash && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Two files drive it:

- `dash/src/data/ledger.json` — the **figures**. Baked by the CLI. **Never yours.**
- `dash/src/data/spec.json` — the **layout**. Yours: choose the blocks and order.

**Do not type a number into spec.json** — no block prop accepts an amount. If a
figure is missing, add a block or a filter, not a literal. Blocks are listed in
`dash/AGENTS.md`. Re-bake with `holiday dash data` after any ledger change; the
dashboard is a snapshot, not a live view.

The built site is static — it reads the baked JSON and never opens ledger.db — so
it deploys to Codex Sites. Bake only what the user will share; it is their money.

## Load these when you need them

Read the one that matches the task, not upfront.

| File | Read it when |
|---|---|
| `references/ledger-model.md` | Explaining *why* a number is what it is — units vs weight, the no-tolerance rule, foreign currency. |
| `references/accounts.md` | Creating or naming an account. |
| `references/schedules.md` | Setting up a card cycle, 할부, or 정기지출. |
| `references/recipes.md` | Recording from a screenshot, FX purchases, refunds, corrections, 마감. |

## What this cannot do yet

- **No OCR.** You are the parser. `ingest submit` takes what you read.
- **No auto-accept.** Every draft needs a human.
- **할부수수료 is not computed.** Read per-row fees off the statement, pass `--fees`.
- **No auto-fetched rates.** `holiday fx add` takes a rate you supply.
- **The dashboard is a snapshot, not live.** Re-bake after any change.
