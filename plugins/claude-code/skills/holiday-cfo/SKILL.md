name: holiday-cfo
description: Record and query a personal double-entry ledger — 가계부, 카드 거래, 부채, 할부, 정기지출, 현금흐름 예측. Use when the user wants to record spending or income, asks what they owe or own, asks whether their cash will survive upcoming card bills (현금흐름), sets up a card/할부/정기지출, or closes their books. Also use when the user shares a screenshot of a bank or card transaction and wants it recorded. Do NOT use for general financial advice or investment questions.

# holiday — a double-entry ledger you drive from chat

`holiday` is a CLI. You run it; it owns the accounting. Every command takes
`--json` for machine-readable output on stdout, and errors always come back as a
single JSON envelope on stderr: `{"error":{"code":"...","message":"..."}}`.

## Running it

The CLI ships on npm, not bundled into this plugin:

```bash
npx @holiday-cfo/cli@latest <command>
```

The first run downloads it. Everything after this document writes `holiday <cmd>`;
read that as `npx @holiday-cfo/cli@latest <cmd>`. Run `holiday --help` or
`holiday <command> --help` for exact flags.

## The rules you must not break

**Never invent an amount, a date, or an account.** If a receipt is blurry or the
user is vague, ask. This is the user's money, and you are the least reliable
component in the system — everything downstream assumes you read `₩1,240,000`
and not `₩1,240,00`.

**Every transaction must balance to exactly zero.** There is no tolerance. If
`holiday txn add` refuses with `unbalanced`, it will tell you the exact residual;
do not "fix" it by nudging a number. Find the missing leg — a fee, a discount, a
rounding line — or ask.

**Never guess an account.** Run `holiday account list` and use what exists. If the
right account is missing, propose creating it and say what you'd call it.

**Show your work before you write.** For anything non-obvious, state the double
entry you're about to post in plain language and let the user confirm.

## Getting oriented

```bash
holiday account list          # what accounts exist
holiday balance               # what is owned and owed right now
holiday balance --account Liabilities
holiday verify                # is the ledger sound and the audit chain intact
```

If a command reports `no .holiday/ found`, the user has no ledger here yet.
`holiday init --currency KRW` creates one — but ask first, and tell them the
directory must be a **private** repository.

## Workflows

The real uses of this tool are routines, not one-off commands. Full detail in
`references/workflows.md`; schedule them on this host via `references/automation.md`.

| Workflow | When | What |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | first session | accounts, opening balances, import a CSV/Excel history (you read the file and script the entries), then offer to schedule the rest |
| **Daily** | each morning | record yesterday, show tomorrow's cash flow |
| **Weekly** | Sunday | assets & liabilities, next week's cash flow, this week reviewed |
| **Monthly** | 1st | assert balances, then `holiday close` |
| **Simulate** | a big decision | `cashflow --spend/--receive` — what-if, folded in, nothing written |
| **Ask** | anytime | answer from the ledger; compute, don't give market advice |

**Record directly with `holiday txn add`.** The review queue is for when you are
genuinely unsure, not a default — the user asked not to approve every coffee, and a
mistake is one more correcting entry, not a lost afternoon.

## From a screenshot

Read the transaction and record it directly — `holiday txn add`, same as any other
entry. You are the parser (there is no OCR), so read the amount carefully:
everything downstream trusts that you saw `₩1,240,000` and not `₩1,240,00`. When an
amount is unclear, ask — do not guess.

Only reach for the review queue when you genuinely want a human to check a batch
before it counts. It holds entries as drafts until accepted:

```bash
holiday ingest submit --idem-key K1 --data '{ "items": [ ... ] }'   # schema in recipes.md
holiday review list
holiday review accept <id>
```

Pass `--idem-key` so a retry replays instead of double-posting, and read
`externalRef` off the screenshot when the issuer prints a transaction id — it is
what tells two identical purchases apart.

## Recording a transaction directly

Legs are `ACCOUNT AMOUNT COMMODITY`, repeated, summing to zero:

```bash
holiday txn add --date 2026-07-17 --payee "이마트" \
  --leg "Expenses:Food:Groceries 42000 KRW" \
  --leg "Liabilities:Card:Shinhan -42000 KRW"
```

A card purchase credits the **card**, not cash — no money moves yet. Paying the
card bill is a separate transaction, later. That gap is the whole point of the
tool; see `references/ledger-model.md`.

## Foreign currency

A non-KRW leg needs its KRW value. Two ways, and they are not equal:

```bash
# both sides observed — the rate is a FACT
--leg "Assets:Bank:Wise:USD 750.00 USD @@ 1000000"

# only one side observed — derived from the rate table, marked fx_estimated
holiday fx add USD KRW 1333.33 --as-of 2026-07-17
holiday txn add --leg "Expenses:Food:Dining 12.50 USD" --leg "Liabilities:Card:Shinhan -12.50 USD"
```

Prefer `@@` whenever the statement shows the KRW amount. A derived weight is
provisional; an observed one is not.

`holiday fx show USD KRW` says which rate would be used and why — exact, stale,
inverted, or triangulated. If it says stale, the user should know.

**A rate never changes a posted number.** Weights are stored as facts, so adding
or correcting a rate only affects future derivations and revaluation. Say so if
the user worries about it.

## 마감

```bash
holiday assert Assets:Bank:KB:Checking 4310000 --as-of 2026-07-31
holiday close 2026-07 --dry-run
holiday close 2026-07
```

**Assertions are the only check that compares the ledger to the outside world.**
Everything else here guards structure — none of it can tell that you read
₩1,240,00 instead of ₩1,240,000. When the user has a statement in front of them,
assert the balance. That is the whole defense against your own misreading.

`close` refuses over unresolved drafts or a failing assertion, and reports every
reason at once. Both refusals are the point, not obstacles — a month with an
unreviewed screenshot is frozen, not closed.

Closing posts an FX revaluation for foreign monetary accounts. It needs a rate at
the month end and an `Income:FX:Unrealized` account.

## Answering "현금흐름 괜찮아?"

```bash
holiday cashflow --until 2026-12-31
```

This is usually the real question behind "how am I doing". It walks forward from
today's cash and subtracts every card bill, 할부 row, and 정기지출 that is
already coming, and flags the day the balance goes negative. Read the ⚠ line out
loud — that is the answer.

**What-if, without writing anything.** For "이 대출 받으면?", "집 사면?", fold the
hypotheticals straight into the runway — do not create and delete speculative
transactions:

```bash
holiday cashflow --until 2027-06-30 \
  --spend "2026-09-01 5000000 새 노트북" \
  --receive "2026-12-25 3000000 보너스"
```

`--spend` is money leaving, `--receive` is arriving — no sign to guess — and both
repeat. Each appears as `가정: <label>`; the ledger is untouched. See the Simulate
workflow in `references/workflows.md`.

## Showing it as a dashboard

When the user wants to *see* it, not read numbers, scaffold a dashboard:

```bash
holiday dash init          # writes ./dash — a vinext app, run anywhere
cd dash && pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Two files drive it, and the split is not optional:

- `dash/src/data/ledger.json` — the **figures**. `holiday dash init` bakes it, and
  `holiday dash data` re-bakes it. **You never touch this.**
- `dash/src/data/spec.json` — the **layout**. This one is yours. Choose which
  blocks appear and in what order.

**Do not type a number into spec.json.** You cannot — no block prop accepts an
amount. If a figure the user wants is not on screen, the fix is a block or a
filter, never a literal. A wrong figure in a well-made card reads as authoritative,
and this is the same rule as everywhere else here: you are the least reliable
component, so the design gives you no way to put a number where it matters.

The blocks are listed in `dash/AGENTS.md`, which lands in the project. In short:
`CashRunway` (the most useful — will the cash survive), `BalanceTable`,
`LedgerHealth`, `Note`.

The snapshot is a point in time. Re-run `holiday dash data` after every `txn add`,
`ingest`, or `close` — a dashboard showing last week's balance is worse than none.

To share it, the built site is static: it reads the baked JSON and opens ledger.db
never, so it deploys to Codex Sites or any static host. Only bake what the user is
willing to share — it is a snapshot of their money.

## Load these when you need them

Do not read these upfront. Read the one that matches the task.

| File | Read it when |
|---|---|
| `references/workflows.md` | Running a routine — setup, daily, weekly, monthly, simulate, and importing a CSV/Excel history. The main map. |
| `references/automation.md` | Scheduling a workflow on this host (Claude Code / Cursor / Codex). |
| `references/ledger-model.md` | The user asks *why* a number is what it is; you need to explain units vs weight, the no-tolerance rule, or foreign currency. |
| `references/accounts.md` | Creating accounts, or unsure how to name or categorise one. |
| `references/schedules.md` | Setting up a card billing cycle, a 할부, or a 정기지출 — and the traps in each. |
| `references/recipes.md` | Recording from a screenshot, FX purchases, refunds, corrections. |

## What this cannot do yet

Say so plainly rather than improvising:

- **No OCR.** You are the parser. `holiday ingest submit` takes what you read;
  it never looks at the image except to hash it.
- **No auto-accept.** Every draft needs a human. There is no rule engine yet.
- **할부수수료 is not computed.** Read the per-row fees off the statement and pass
  `--fees`; issuer formulas differ and a plausible wrong number would corrupt the
  cash flow projection.
- **No auto-fetched rates.** `holiday fx add` takes a rate you supply; nothing
  calls an API. A missing rate throws rather than guessing.
- **The dashboard is a snapshot, not a live view.** It renders what
  `holiday dash data` last baked. It does not follow the ledger — re-bake after
  any change, or it shows stale figures with a confident face.
