# Setup — the first session

Record directly, fix later — this is the default across all workflows (see the
skill body). The goal here is a ledger that reflects reality now, then as much
history as is worth entering.

1. **Create it.** `holiday init --currency KRW` (ask the currency).
2. **Accounts — offer the standard chart.** Propose `../concepts/chart.md` ("이
   표준 차트로 시작할까요?") and create what the user accepts, then their actual
   banks/cards/debts on top. Mark spendable accounts `--cash`. Set card billing
   cycles with `holiday card add`, 할부 and 정기지출, loans. Naming rules in
   `../concepts/accounts.md`, schedules in `../concepts/schedules.md`.
3. **Classification rules, before importing — do not skip this.** And seed them
   from the DATA, not from imagination: parse the raw file first (without
   importing), count payees by frequency, and bring the user the top of that
   list — "이 20개 가맹점이 전체 거래의 60%입니다. 스타벅스→Food:Cafe,
   LGU+→Telecom …으로 잡을까요?" Confirm the mapping, then `holiday rule add`
   each one. One rule classifies every matching row across ten years at once,
   which is why this scan pays for itself instantly — the queue that survives to
   the categorize screen should hold only the genuinely ambiguous tail. Rules
   only fire on `money` items (see the import section), so this step and the
   item format below are one mechanism: skip either half and every row lands
   unclassified.
4. **Opening balances.** For each asset/liability that already has a balance, post
   it against `Equity:Opening` dated the start point:
   `holiday txn add --date 2026-01-01 --leg "Assets:Bank:Shinhan 4310000 KRW" --leg "Equity:Opening -4310000 KRW"`.
5. **History, if they have a file.** This is where you earn your keep — see below.
6. **Confirm.** `holiday balance`, then `holiday assert` each account against what
   the user can see in their banking app. Assertions are the only check against the
   outside world; use them.
7. **Offer automation.** Once the ledger is real, ask about scheduling the daily /
   weekly / monthly workflows — `../automation.md`.

## Importing a CSV or Excel export — you are the importer

There is no `import` command, on purpose. Every bank's export is shaped
differently, and a rigid parser would fight that. You are a better importer than a
fixed schema: **read the file, work out what its columns mean, and write a script
that builds `money` items for one `ingest submit` batch.** You extract the facts;
the rule table classifies; the human arbitrates the leftovers. That division is
the whole reason this is an agent task and not a CLI flag.

- Read the file. Figure out which column is the date, which is the amount, which is
  the description, and the sign convention (is a debit negative, or in a separate
  column?).
- **Emit `money` items — facts only. Do NOT build the category leg yourself.**

  ```json
  { "date": "2016-03-17", "payee": "체크카드 버거킹고대중앙광장",
    "money": { "account": "Assets:Bank:KB:Start", "amount": "-5300", "commodity": "KRW" } }
  ```

  The CLI completes the double entry: a rule picks the category (and the row
  posts under `--post`); no rule → it parks in Uncategorized as a DRAFT for the
  categorize screen. **The moment you write the category leg yourself, you have
  switched the classifier off** — a full-`legs` item is treated as decided, rules
  never run, and no queue appears. This exact mistake once posted 10,191 rows
  straight into Uncategorized with zero drafts. Full `legs` are for rows that
  genuinely carry their own category (FX with `@@`, or a category the file
  itself states) — never for "I don't know", and never `...:Uncategorized` by
  hand (the CLI now drafts those anyway, with a warning).
- **Before parsing anything, run `holiday ingest list`.** It shows every import
  that ever ran — which source files, when, how many rows. The ledger is the
  provenance record, not your memory of the session; a file already listed is
  done, skip it.
- Post them, **one source file = one submission**:

  ```bash
  holiday ingest submit --post --data-file batch.json --source "raw_data/bank-2024.html"
  ```

  `--data-file` reads the `{ "items": [ ... ] }` JSON your script built (argv has a
  ~1MB limit, so inline `--data` forces chunking on big files — and chunking breaks
  the file↔batch mapping). `--source` hashes the RAW export into the batch record:
  re-importing identical bytes is refused by the ledger itself (`duplicate_source`),
  and the file name shows up in `ingest list`. That pairing is what lets the next
  session see exactly what is in without re-deriving anything.
- For a few hundred rows a loop of `holiday txn add` is also fine — but it leaves
  no source record, so prefer the batch path whenever the rows came from a file.
  Do NOT loop `txn add` for thousands of rows: each call pays ~30ms of node
  startup, so 8,000 rows is ~9 minutes; the batch is one process and posts in
  seconds. `--post` commits directly (no review queue).
- Then `holiday verify` and `holiday balance`, and `assert` the closing balance
  against the statement so a mis-parsed sign shows up immediately.
- **If unmatched drafts remain, put the categorize screen in front of the user —
  don't make them ask.** Scaffold the dash if it doesn't exist
  (`holiday dash init`), START the dev server yourself (your host can run and preview it — do
  that, rather than pasting instructions), and point them at the 분류 대기 card:
  one click per decision, ⌥-click to also save the rule. Rules they teach it
  there shrink the next import's queue. Batch alternative when a pattern is
  obvious: `holiday rule add` → `holiday review apply-rules --accept`.

Never invent an amount or a date to make a row balance. If a row is ambiguous, ask.

**Transfers between the user's own accounts are the trap here** — one transfer
shows up as a withdrawal in one file and a deposit in another, and merging them is
its own problem (the row never says which account it went to). Import the accounts
you have, then match transfers per `../concepts/transfers.md` — the pairing logic
is already written (`../../scripts/match-transfers.mjs`); you only write the
per-bank parser.
