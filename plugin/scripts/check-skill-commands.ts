/**
 * Verifies the skill's claims about the CLI against the CLI.
 *
 * Both directions, because both have already gone wrong here:
 *
 *   1. The skill referenced `holiday card list` before it existed. An agent
 *      following it would have run a command that is not there.
 *   2. The skill said "no period close and no FX rate table" after both shipped.
 *      An agent reading that skips a real feature and improvises around it —
 *      which is worse, because it looks like it worked.
 *
 * The second is why "what this cannot do" needs checking at all. A stale
 * capability list reads as authoritative and quietly makes the agent dumber.
 *
 * Run: pnpm --filter holiday-plugin check:skill
